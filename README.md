## A new way to easily build RubyMotion apps.

ProMotion is a RubyMotion gem that makes iOS development more like Ruby and less like Objective-C.
It introduces a clean, Ruby-style syntax for building screens that is easy to learn and remember and
abstracts a ton of boilerplate UIViewController, UINavigationController, and other iOS code into a
simple, Ruby-like DSL.

```ruby
class AppDelegate < PM::Delegate
  def on_load(app, options)
    open RootScreen.new(nav_bar: true)
  end
end

class RootScreen < PM::Screen
  title "Root Screen"
  
  def push_new_screen
    open NewScreen
  end
end

class NewScreen < PM::TableScreen
  title "Table Screen"
  
  def table_data
    [{
      cells: [
        { title: "About this app", action: :tapped_about },
        { title: "Log out", action: :log_out }
      ]
    }]
  end
end
```

# Help

If you need help, feel free to ping me on twitter [@jamonholmgren](http://twitter.com/jamonholmgren)
or open an issue on GitHub. Opening an issue is usually the best and we respond to those pretty quickly.

# Contributing

I'm very open to ideas. Tweet me with your ideas or open a ticket (I don't mind!)
and let's discuss. **It's a good idea to run your idea by the committers before creating
a pull request.** We'll always consider your ideas carefully but not all ideas will be
incorporated.

## Working on Features

1. Clone the repos into `Your-Project/Vendor/ProMotion`
2. Update your `Gemfile`to reference the project as `gem 'ProMotion', :path => "vendor/ProMotion/"`
3. Run `bundle`
4. Run `rake clean` and then `rake`
5. Contribute!

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the project
2. Create a feature branch
3. Code
4. Update or create new specs ** NOTE: your PR is far more likely to be merged if you include comprehensive tests! **
5. Make sure tests are passing by running `rake spec` *(you can run functional and unit specs separately with `rake spec:functional` and `rake spec:unit`)*
6. Submit pull request
7. Make a million little nitpicky changes that @jamonholmgren wants
8. Merged, then fame, adoration, kudos everywhere
